# react-sample

react-sample is a React demo application to show isomorphic rendering.

## Quick start

To run react-sample, first install its dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then, simply run

```bash
$ npm run start
```

and point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Please note

Please note that this code is only meant to be a demo of isomorphic rendering. Do not consider it to be production-ready. Additionally, it does not follow any best practices. To be production-ready, at least the following things need to be changed:

- The directory and file structure needs to be reworked.
- Tests need to be added.
- The code needs some clean-up.

Hence, to cut a long story short, please take this sample with a grain of salt.
